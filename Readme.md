We are a team of students at Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh, PA. We love web development and graphics processing and wanted to use this event as an excuse to make a fun, shiny HTML5 game.

## Description

Meowtex is an HTML5 game that teaches mutex concepts to beginner programmers in a fun way. These adorable cats will walk towards their goal, but you need to use mutual exclusion principles to keep them from stepping into the same pen as another cat or they'll tear each other apart. 
Extensive research has revealed to us that people will do/learn/master anything to save kitties.
